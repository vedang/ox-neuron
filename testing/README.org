#+TITLE: Testing ox-neuron
#+PROPERTY: header-args:emacs-lisp :results silent

This test-suite assumes that [[https://github.com/Wilfred/propcheck][propcheck]] is installed.

* Interactive testing from within Emacs

To run this test suite from a current Emacs instance simply load and run the test suite with the following commands.

1) First load the test suite.
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var here=(buffer-file-name)
     (add-to-list 'load-path (file-name-directory here))
     (add-to-list 'load-path (diredp-parent-dir (file-name-directory here)))
     (require 'ox-neuron)
     (require 'test-ox-neuron)
   #+END_SRC

2) To run one test: Compile the test and then ~M-x ert RET <test-name> RET~. When not visible yet switch to the ERT results buffer named ~*ert*~. When a test failed the ERT results buffer shows the details of the first ~should~ that failed. See ~(info "(ert)Running Tests Interactively")~ on how to re-run, start the debugger etc.

3) To run all the ~ox-neuron~ tests: ~M-x ert RET "^test-ox-neuron/" RET~.

4) To run all tests of a single test file: ~M-x ert-delete-all-tests RET~ and confirm. ~M-x load-file RET testing/<file>.el RET M-x ert RET t RET~.

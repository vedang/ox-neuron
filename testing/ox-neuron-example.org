Cheese is the only milk product I have tasted so far that was not independently invented in India as well. I wonder why?

* Kharvas
<point>Kharvas</point> is delicious, but this entry (in itself) is not a valid Neuron post, because it does not have any :ID: field. Note that if I run the get-valid-post function here, the full contents of the file will be returned. Even though this entry is not valid, it's parent (the file) is a valid entry.
